Version 0.16
- New -noexport command line option to force an empty symbol table

Version 0.15, released on 2009-02-25
- protects calls to cygpath with long command lines (patch from
  Matthieu Dubuget)
- always pass msvcrt.lib to link.exe

Version 0.14, released on 2008-28-01
- mingw port: put /lib/mingw before /lib
- support for a built-in linker

Version 0.13, released on 2008-11-20
- another technique to work around the lack of response file for gcc: 
  put the command line in an external bash script and apply bash to it
  (relies on the fact that Cygwin programs can call Cygwin programs
  with long command lines); this idea is from Xavier Leroy
- the -subsystem switch is now supported for the mingw toolchain

Version 0.12, released on 2008-11-17
- gcc 3 does not support response files; to support longer command lines, we use a
  custom replacement for cmd.exe (which restricts the length of the command line
  to 8kB whereas Windows supports 32kB)
- patch for Richard Jones: do not find directories when looking for a file

Version 0.11, released on 2008-11-10
- compiled with mingw port so as to depend on msvcrt.dll, not msvcr80.dll
- experimental support for directly calling "ld" instead of "gcc"
- by default, reexport symbols imported from an import library
- quote the response file argument
- use slashes instead of backslashed in response file (needed for mingw's ld)
- by default, use the real manifest

Version 0.10, released on 2008-10-21
- use "gcc -mno-cygwin -print-libgcc-file-name" to get the standard
  library directory for mingw
- lower the length threshold to use a diversion file when calling the
  linker with many arguments

Version 0.9, released on 2008-09-18
 - fix bug with COFF symbols for sections (with more than 1 auxilliary block)
 - ignore debug relocations on x86 (of kind 0x000a, 0x000b)

Version 0.8, released on 2008-03-10
 - new -no-merge-manifest

Version 0.7, released on 2008-03-09
 - allow .dll.a as automatic extension for libraries
 - minor bug fixes

Version 0.6, released on 2008-02-11
 - support COMDAT section symbols
 - support mixed libraries (import library + regular objects)
 - optimizations (do not rewrite library objects when not needed,
   pass the lib to the linker)
 - new -real-manifest, replace -default-manifest
 - new -implib option
 - new -outdef option
 - new zlib/libpng license

Version 0.5, released on 2008-01-11
 - new -default-manifest option (always on, currently)
 - use a temp file name for getting the output of commands (allow 
   several instances of flexlink to run in parallel)

Version 0.4, released on 2008-01-02
 - Code cleanup
 - FLEXLINKFLAGS env var to pass extra arguments

Version 0.3, released on 2007-11-20
 - Make it work under x86_64
 - New -subsystem option (currently for MSVC chain only)
 - New -explain option
 - New -link option

Version 0.2, released on 2007-11-06
 - New -maindll option (to build a DLL that contains the "main program" 
   from FlexDLL's point of view) 
 - Can now explicitly enable/disable the use of cygpath (on by default
   only for Cygwin)
 - New -L xxx (or -Lxxx) option
 - New -where option
 - FLEXDIR environment variable (where to look for FlexDLL's .obj files)

Version 0.1, released on 2007-06-14
 - Initial release
